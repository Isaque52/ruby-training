# Report Grade - Dice Games

Report for Isaac, for the Dice Games project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **30%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate - **30%**
  * Did your code pass when I ran it?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **30%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed all redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **10%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)
  * Did you manage to refactor the test on `spec/dice_spec.rb:41`

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

B

Dice - B/C - Some good examples, but again very patchy. It's hard to see evolution. This is possibly exacerbated
by the git commits being hard to understand

Greed - B - Slightly better. But again it's quite tricky to see where you're evolving and where you're doing
what due to the erratic git work

### Pass Rate

A - No issues

### White box analysis

D

This is extremely complex to digest in greed, and both projects could use heavy linting work

### Miscellaneous Criteria

D

This is also hard to track and the broken spec wasn't remedied

### Overall Grade

B

You just scraped a B

Try to focus heavily on the smaller items (Linting / Git work), as these are the areas that the same issues
are cropping up in each project
