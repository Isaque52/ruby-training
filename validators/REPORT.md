## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **30%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate - **40%**
  * Did your code pass when I ran it?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **30%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

B

You did a lot of good red-green refactoring. However there are a couple of implementations that aren't
strictly true, and only pass due to the way in which the brief tests are written

I didn't mark you down for your Pass Rate because it still all passed, but there was opportunities to refactor up
and write the correct code which you missed

### Pass Rate

A

There's a couple of implementations that aren't strictly correct. But given you pass all criteria specified it's
an A grade still

### White box analysis

B

Aside from minor inconsistencies, this good code

However there are a **lot** of minor inconsistencies, so this is something you should work on in your next
project as the finishing step to get that perfect grade

### Overall Grade

B

Almost an A, but all the big mistakes are now missing, it's just there are lots of little mistakes
