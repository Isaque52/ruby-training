  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor in the correct places?
* Pass Rate - **25%**
  * Did your code pass when I ran it?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **30%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)

* Miscellaneous Criteria - **15%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)
  * Incremental working through `skip`

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

B

You did some pretty good TDD. Although it still is a bit patchy when / if you do your refactoring. Try ensure
you are doing red-green-refactor not red-green-red-green-red-green-refactor

### Pass Rate

A

No issues, all pass. Bit of weird linting going on though

### White box analysis

B

The end product is pretty good and concise

Your linting is still quite a way off. Try and make the code neat and tidy, as well as succinct

Be mindful of super long lines (Here it's almost unavoidable)

### Miscellaneous Criteria

C

Your git commits are still not very easy to trace. You need to ensure you're explaining the why, not the what
because I can see the what from the code

You did incrementally work through skip. So I gave you credit for that

### Overall Grade

B

Solid B grade, very good attempt

I think there are lots of tiny mistakes you are making, but the large bulk you are getting correct now
