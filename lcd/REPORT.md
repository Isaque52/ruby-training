# Report Grade - LCD

Report for Isaac, for the LCD project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **35%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor for the suggested steps provided in the README?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor once it came to the stretch goals?
* Pass Rate - **15%**
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
  * Did you pass the `lcd_numbers_spec.rb` in its entirety?
  * Did you pass all tests?
* White box analysis - **45%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed **all** redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **5%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

D

Whilst you have shown some evolution, it goes in very small steps then one big solution point

I cannot see any / all evolution points, as such if something went wrong, there is no intermediate checkpoint

### Pass Rate

C

Passed both basic specs. Missed quite a bit of technical implementation details for the advanced specs

### White box analysis

C

You have managed to split it into smaller more concise pieces, and each method is small

But....

- Linting is poor, make sure we're taking care over our static analysis
- Code refinement hasn't been done. Some of the branches can be simpler
- Try avoid localised variables making methods more bloated than needed

### Miscellaneous Criteria

E

Unfortunately your git work is really hard to trace, as such I cannot give a higher grade

### Overall Grade

C

You just scraped a C. Make sure to re-read the marking scheme as a few of the points I feel you missed
from the original problem
